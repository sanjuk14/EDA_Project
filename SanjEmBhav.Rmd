## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Written some code to explore and show your reader the structure of your dataset and the different variables involved, performing some initial data restructuring, filtering, and cleaning.
## Visualized the distribution of some of these variables and calculated some core tendency measures.
## Put some thought into how you are breaking up your code into chunks that you will contextualize for your reader.
## Started writing some text walking your reader through what the chunks of code you've produced so far do, according to the conventions of literate programming.
## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
